# Retargeting comparison

`scripts/compare_retargeters.py` evaluates the fixed-base Gen3 using one
mounted-base preprocessing pass. Each sampled human frame creates one shared
`HumanArmTarget`, including the configured physical task point.

Method 0 (`sew_mimic`) remains the legacy regression baseline. Method 2
(`exact_sew`) is the recommended fixed-base pinch-pose plus Stereo-SEW method.
Method 3 (`numerical_oracle`) is validation-only and runs only its deterministic
requested subset; it never seeds or selects any production method.

WARP-cSEW is reported only as capability metadata. Its generic core exists, but
the current Gen3 fails the fixed-link compatibility measurement, so it never
creates executable per-frame comparison rows.

Run the bounded validation comparison from the repository root:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\compare_retargeters.py `
  --input data\test.csv `
  --methods sew_mimic exact_sew `
  --exact-branch-policy continuous `
  --max-frames 100
```

Add `numerical_oracle --oracle-max-frames 10` to the method list to validate a
deterministic leading subset of the same selected frames. Method 3 does not run
on every frame unless the requested subset covers every selected frame.

Use `--all` intentionally for a complete trajectory. The event-aware Method 2
solver currently takes about 3.8 seconds per frame, so a full 4,344-frame run
is not part of normal validation. `--exact-branch-policy` chooses canonical or
continuous selection; `--compare-exact-policies` emits both labels while
sharing candidate enumeration. Continuous is recommended for trajectories. It
keeps the most recently successful joint configuration across failures; a
failed result never replaces branch-selection history.

Output is `output/comparison_frames.csv` and
`output/comparison_summary.json` unless `--output-dir` is supplied. Failed
frames remain in the CSV and denominator statistics with empty joint/error
fields. Error and joint-limit statistics explicitly use successful frames
only. Every successful row independently recomputes the physical pinch-site
pose, joint limits, and robot Stereo-SEW from the MuJoCo-derived FK.

The summary reports the reproduced generic WARP-cSEW core separately from
solver outcomes. Current Gen3 fixed-link compatibility is false because the
measured virtual upper-arm length varies by about 0.19513668 m; forearm and
wrist-to-task variations are at floating-point noise. See
`docs/WARP_CSEW_CORE.md`. This project does not claim a Gen3 WARP reproduction
and creates no WARP trajectory rows.
